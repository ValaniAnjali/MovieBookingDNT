Admin Login Functionality

File Upload for movie images

Session Management

Database Connectivity using ADO.NET

Use of Partial Views for reusable components

Use of Layout Views for consistent page design

Displays all available movies with their name, release date, description, and image.

Booking Page:
Users can view the movies and proceed with booking (future extension idea).

Authentication:
Simple login mechanism for admin access (username and password hardcoded).

Partial Views:
Reusable parts of the website like headers, footers, or navigation bars are created using Partial Views.

Layout View:
A single layout is shared across multiple pages to ensure a consistent design (like a master template).

Database:
All movie details are stored in an SQL Server database (Demo database, Movies table).
